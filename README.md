## Frontend Interview Task

## Interview Prompt
For this interview, we'll be making a really simple application that is meant
for you to demonstrate your skills as a frontend developer.

Please create a frontend with "fake" api calls to implement the following feature-set:

- Signup Flow
- Login Flow
- Create a Todo
- Edit a Todo
- Remove a Todo
- Update a Todo
- List existing Todos

Remember, the goal is for you to show your process, your creativity, and a little bit of ingenuity.

NOTE: No backend is expected. This is intended to be simple, so don't worry about saving a password to a
database or anything like that. Come up with your own way of "faking" api calls to demonstrate these features.


For Sign up, we only need a username and password.
Login will use that username and password to get in.

Finally, create a simple, clean design for users to interact and create a Todo list.
